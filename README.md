hi there, it just a dirty try to combine a JFXDatePicker with JFXTimePicker to merged control JFXDateTimePicker of jfoenix library
this odd job supports all functional that original controls have to offer
some moving animation added to change bewtween date and time pickers
some little microscopic bugs of original controls are found and destroyed (so, I should report about it to jfoenix with ways to solve)
